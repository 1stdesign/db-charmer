  <h3>What Ruby and Rails implementations does it work for?</h3>

  <p>We have a <a href="http://travis-ci.org/#!/kovyrin/db-charmer-sandbox/builds">continuous 
  integration setup</a> for this gem on with Rails 2.2, 2.3 and 3.0 using a few different 
  versions of Ruby. For more information about the build matrix please visit the
  <a href="http://github.com/kovyrin/db-charmer-sandbox">db-charmer-sandbox</a> project site.</p>

  <p>In addition to CI testing, we use this gem in production on Scribd.com (one
  of the largest RoR sites in the world) with Ruby Enterprise Edition and
  Rails 2.2, Rails 2.3, Sinatra and plain Rack applications.</p>

  <p>Starting with version 1.7.0 we support Rails 3.0, but until further notice
  we consider it a beta-quality feature since we do not run any production
  software on this version of Rails. If you run your application on Rails
  3.0, please contact the author.</p>
