  <h3>What Ruby and Rails implementations does it work for?</h3>

  <p>We have a <a href="http://travis-ci.org/#!/kovyrin/db-charmer-sandbox/builds">continuous 
  integration setup</a> for this gem on with Rails 2.2, 2.3 and 3.0 using a few different 
  versions of Ruby. For more information about the build matrix please visit the
  <a href="http://github.com/kovyrin/db-charmer-sandbox">db-charmer-sandbox</a> project site.
  Current status of the build:</p>
  
  <ul> 
    <li>Rails 2.2.3  <img src="https://secure.travis-ci.org/kovyrin/db-charmer-sandbox.png?branch=rails22" alt="Build Status: rails 2.2"/></li> 
    <li>Rails 2.3.14 <img src="https://secure.travis-ci.org/kovyrin/db-charmer-sandbox.png?branch=rails22" alt="Build Status: rails 2.3"/></li> 
    <li>Rails 3.0.10 <img src="https://secure.travis-ci.org/kovyrin/db-charmer-sandbox.png?branch=master" alt="Build Status: rails 3.0"/></li> 
  </ul>

  <p>In addition to CI testing, we use this gem in production on <a href="http://www.scribd.com/">Scribd.com</a> (one
  of the largest RoR sites in the world) with Ruby Enterprise Edition and
  Rails 2.2/2.3, Sinatra and even plain Rack applications.</p>

  <p>Starting with version 1.7.0 we support Rails 3.0, but until further notice
  we consider it a beta-quality feature since we do not run any production
  software on this version of Rails. If you run your application on Rails
  3.0, please contact the author.</p>


  <h3>Where can I find a changelog for the latest release?</h3>
  
  <p>There are two ways of getting a list of changes for any particular version:</p>
  
  <ul>
    <li>You can check out the <a href="https://github.com/kovyrin/db-charmer/blob/master/CHANGES">CHANGES</a> file</li>
    <li>Since all the changes are tagged in git, you can use <code>git log</code> command (or Github's web interface) to get a list of commits between any two versions:
{% highlight bash %}
git log v1.6.5..v1.6.6 # to get a list of changes between two versions
git log v1.6.5..HEAD   # to get a list of all the changes since v1.6.5
{% endhighlight %}
    </li>
  </ul>
