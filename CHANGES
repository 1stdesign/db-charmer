1.4.6 -> 1.5.0:

Major change in this version of DbCharmer is association preload support. For example,
let's say we have a schema:

    class Post < ActiveRecord::Base
      belongs_to :user
    end

    class User < ActiveRecord::Base
      has_many :posts
    end

Now, if we have the following call in our code:

    User.on_db(:foo).all(:include => :posts)

In 1.4.6 it would load the users from connection :foo and posts from the
default connection, which is not what we would expect from this line of code.
So, starting 1.5.0 all finder calls on models having :include parameter would
switch associated models' connections to the same connection as the main model
in the call.
