1.5.0 -> 1.5.1:

In this version we've added support for connection names logging in Rails queries log.
New log records have [connection_name] prefix for all queries that are executed on
non-standard connections:

[logs]   LogRecord Columns (1.1ms)   SHOW FIELDS FROM `log_records`
[logs]   User Delete all (0.1ms)   DELETE FROM `users`
[slave01]   User Load (0.2ms)   SELECT * FROM `users` WHERE (`users`.`login` = 'foo')

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1.4.6 -> 1.5.0:

Major change in this version of DbCharmer is association preload support. For example,
let's say we have a schema:

    class Post < ActiveRecord::Base
      belongs_to :user
    end

    class User < ActiveRecord::Base
      has_many :posts
    end

Now, if we have the following call in our code:

    User.on_db(:foo).all(:include => :posts)

In 1.4.6 it would load the users from connection :foo and posts from the
default connection, which is not what we would expect from this line of code.
So, starting 1.5.0 all finder calls on models having :include parameter would
switch associated models' connections to the same connection as the main model
in the call.
